Missing values are everywhere, and you don't want them interfering with your work. 
Some functions ignore missing data by default, but that's not always the behavior you might want. 
Some functions can't handle missing values at all, so these values need to be taken care of before you can use them.
If you don't know where your missing values are, or if they exist, you could make mistakes in your analysis.
