The dataset has been taken from John Hopkin’s repository and you can find the link: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports

The dataset here the below features:

Province/State
Country/Region
Last Update
Confirmed
Deaths
Recovered
Lattitude
Longitude

I have added the feature of Temperature and Humidity for Latitude and Longitude using Python’s Weather API – Pyweatherbit (https://www.weatherbit.io/)
. A common perception about COVID-19 is that Warm Climate is more resistant to the corona outbreak and we need to verify this using Hypothesis Testing. So what will our null and alternate hypothesis be?

Null Hypothesis: Temperature doesn’t affect COV-19 Outbreak
Alternate Hypothesis: Temperature does affect COV-19 Outbreak

I am considering Temperature below 24 as Cold Climate and above 24 as Hot Climate in our dataset.

There are certain limitations of the Z test for COVID-19 datasets:

Sample data may not be well representative of population data
Sample variance may not be a good estimator of the population variance
Variability in a state’s capacity to deal with this pandemic
Socio-Economic Reasons
Early breakout in certain places
Some states could be hiding the data for geopolitical reasons
